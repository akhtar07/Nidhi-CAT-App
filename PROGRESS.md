# Progress log

## Milestone order (revised)
Original SPEC.md §15 order is sequential (0,1,2,3,...). Revised for this build:

**0 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 5 → ...**

Milestone 2 (Storage layer / StorageAdapter / DexieAdapter) is deferred until
after Milestone 3 (Content pipeline v1). Rationale: the pipeline emits JSON
into `/content` and has no dependency on learner-state storage, so there's no
reason to block content ingestion on it. All other milestones keep their
original numbers and order from SPEC.md §15.

## Current milestone: 1 — Schemas & syllabus (not started)

## Binding decision recorded ahead of Milestone 1
So the pipeline (Python) and app (TypeScript) content schemas can never drift,
Milestone 1 will be implemented as:

- **`/pipeline/schemas.py`** (pydantic v2) is the single source of truth for
  every content type in SPEC.md §5.1 (`MicroTopic`, `Lesson`, `Question`,
  `PassageSet`, etc.).
- JSON Schemas are **generated** from the pydantic models into
  `/content/schemas/*.json`.
- TypeScript types are **generated** from those JSON Schemas into
  `/app/src/types/content.ts` via `json-schema-to-typescript` (new dev
  dependency, added to SPEC.md §7 tooling — approved as part of this
  decision, do not ask again).
- Both generated outputs (`/content/schemas/*.json` and
  `/app/src/types/content.ts`) are committed to git.
- CI regenerates both from `/pipeline/schemas.py` on every push and fails the
  build if the regenerated output differs from what's committed (drift
  check).
- **Never hand-edit `/app/src/types/content.ts` or `/content/schemas/*.json`.**
  Change `/pipeline/schemas.py` and regenerate.

Learner-state types (SPEC.md §5.2 — `Attempt`, `MasteryState`, `PlanDay`,
`MockResult`, `Settings`) are NOT part of this generation pipeline; they are
TypeScript-native (Milestone 2, storage layer) since they never need to be
produced or validated by the Python pipeline.

## Completed

### Milestone 0 — Repo scaffold (done)
- `/app`: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript strict + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
  (`base-nova` style, neutral base color, `dark` class variant support).
  `Button` component installed as the first shadcn primitive.
- Path alias `@/*` → `app/src/*` wired in `tsconfig.json`/`tsconfig.app.json`
  (no `baseUrl` — deprecated in the installed TS 6.0 toolchain, `paths`
  resolves relative to the tsconfig file instead) and `vite.config.ts`.
- `react-router-dom` with `HashRouter` (avoids the GitHub Pages
  404-on-refresh trap per SPEC.md §7). Single placeholder route at `/`
  rendering `src/pages/Today.tsx`.
- `vite.config.ts` → `base: '/Nidhi-CAT-App/'` for the
  `akhtar07/Nidhi-CAT-App` GitHub Pages deployment. Verified via
  `vite preview` that all asset URLs resolve under that base.
- Lint via `oxlint` (installed by the shadcn CLI in place of ESLint;
  equivalent role — fails CI on errors). `npm run typecheck` (`tsc -b`)
  separated from `npm run build` (`vite build`) so CI can run them as
  distinct steps.
- Top-level `/content` and `/pipeline` folders created (each with a short
  README) as placeholders for Milestones 1 and 3; both empty pending those
  milestones. `/pipeline/raw/` exists locally and is gitignored per the new
  hard rule.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: on push to `main`, runs
  `npm ci → lint → typecheck → build` in `/app`, then deploys `app/dist` to
  GitHub Pages via `actions/configure-pages` +
  `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages` (Pages source =
  GitHub Actions, already configured on the repo).
- Verified live: pushed to `main`, workflow run succeeded
  (run id 31280771973), `https://akhtar07.github.io/Nidhi-CAT-App/` returns
  200 with the placeholder page and correctly prefixed asset paths.

## Schema changes since SPEC.md
- SPEC.md §6: added a hard rule — raw source material (PYQ PDFs, scraped
  HTML, third-party solution text) is never committed; lives in
  `/pipeline/raw/` (gitignored). Only pipeline-generated JSON in `/content/`
  is committed, and every asset must carry a `licence` field or CI fails.
- SPEC.md §7 (pending, to apply when Milestone 1 lands): add
  `json-schema-to-typescript` as a frontend dev dependency, per the binding
  decision above.

## Known issues / deferred
- Milestone 2 (Storage layer) deferred until after Milestone 3 — see
  "Milestone order" above.
